# Logistic Regression - Binary classification
Aim of this project is to learn classification problem through telco churn data. Using classification algorithm, we will separate customer who goes out of that network as 1 and the one who stays with same network as zero.
In this case, we will identify each customer score, based on that we will classify that into two categories.
