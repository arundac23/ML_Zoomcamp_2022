# Image Classification of landscape scenes:

This project work is based on [Alexey Grigorev's](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev) course #MLZOOMCAMP. The original repository of this course is located [here](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp)

## Dataset details:
This is image data of natural Scenes around the world.
`The original dataset is available here` [dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification)

`This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.

### ['buildings','forest','glacier','mountain','sea','street']

The Train, val, test and Prediction data is separated in folders. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in validation and 64 in test and 7k in pred folder.

## Project Description:

For this capstone project_1, I decided to work on image classification using deep learning cnn architecture.Since I am a complete beginner in deep learning concepts, I took a simple image classification task for this project. Due to time constraint i am not able to explore all other concepts or tools of deep learning during this project. I just followed the same techniques that were taught during the MLzoompcamp deep learning session. Hoping to explore different concepts during the upcoming capstone project_2.

For this project, I didn't train this images from scratch.Since it requires large set of images to improve accuracy. I used transfer learning techinique for image feature extraction.
